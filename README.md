# Hello, I'm Jesus Guerra üëã

I'm an iOS Developer from Hermosillo, Sonora. I'm married to an amazing woman and together we do our best to educate and raise our two wonderful kids.

I consider myself a passionate, self-taught and resourceful iOS Engineer, I truly love what I do and enjoy doing it. Over the past 9+ years, I have been lucky enough to collaborate and participate in a wide variety of iOS projects and meet great and talented iOS Engineers from which I have absorbed as much knowledge as possible to improve my skills and improve my ways to approach daily work challenges. I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way.
